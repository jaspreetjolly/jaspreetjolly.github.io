# Microsoft 365 Copilot: Data Privacy & Security Commitments

As organisations accelerate their adoption of AI-powered productivity tools, **data privacy and security remain paramount**. Microsoft 365 Copilot is engineered to meet the highest enterprise-grade standards, ensuring customer data is protected *by design* and *by contract*.  

This blog outlines the **legal, technical, and compliance foundations** that safeguard how Copilot operates inside Microsoft 365 environments, referencing Microsoft’s most recent commitments and certifications.

---

## 1. Data Residency and Processing

### **Data Stays Within Microsoft 365**
All prompts, retrieved content, embeddings, and Copilot responses are processed **exclusively within the Microsoft 365 environment**, using Azure OpenAI infrastructure.  
No prompts, documents, or responses are ever shared with public OpenAI services or external third parties.

### **No Data Used for Model Training**
Customer data — including prompts, documents, chat history, and Copilot-generated responses — is **never used to train large language models**.  
Enterprise data remains strictly segregated from foundation model training pipelines.

## 2. Enterprise-Grade Privacy and Security

### **Access Controls and DLP Enforcement**
Copilot fully respects existing Microsoft 365 security frameworks, including:

- Entra ID permissions  
- SharePoint/OneDrive access controls  
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)  
- Sensitivity labels  
- Conditional access policies  

Copilot only surfaces information the **user already has permission to access**.

### **Security by Design**
Copilot follows Microsoft’s Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL), including:

- Continuous threat modelling  
- Privacy impact assessments  
- Secure coding practices  
- Proactive vulnerability management  

Security and privacy are integrated at every layer.

## 3. Contractual and Regulatory Safeguards

### **Microsoft’s Data Protection Addendum (DPA)**
All Copilot data processing is governed by:

- The **Microsoft Data Protection Addendum (DPA)**  
- The **Product Terms**  
- The **Microsoft Privacy Statement**

These legally binding documents define Microsoft’s responsibilities and data-handling obligations.

### **Customer Copyright Commitment**
Microsoft provides legal defence for customers against third-party claims related to Copilot-generated content, provided that:

- Safety systems are not disabled  
- Copilot output is not intentionally misused  
- Customers have rights to input data  

This allows organisations to use Copilot with confidence.

## 4. Certified Compliance

### **Global Certifications**
Microsoft 365 Copilot complies with international standards including:

- **SOC 2**  
- **ISO 42001** (AI Management System Standard)  
- **GDPR**  

These are validated through independent audits.

### **EU Data Boundary Support**
Copilot helps organisations meet EU data residency requirements by processing and storing data within the EU boundary for European customers.

## 5. Responsible AI and Safety Systems

### **Built on Microsoft’s Responsible AI Framework**
Microsoft’s core Responsible AI principles guide Copilot’s design:

- Fairness  
- Reliability & safety  
- Privacy & security  
- Inclusiveness  
- Transparency  
- Accountability  

Includes:

- Harmful content filtering  
- Sensitive data detection  
- Prompt injection defence mechanisms  

### **No Retention of Prompts or Responses**
Copilot does **not** store user prompts or conversations after the session ends.

## 6. Transparency and Documentation

### **Copilot Transparency Note**
Microsoft provides a detailed Transparency Note explaining:

- How LLMs integrate with Microsoft 365 apps  
- How data flows through the Copilot service  
- What protections govern data access  

### **Audit Reports and Compliance Documentation**
Customers can access SOC 2, ISO 42001, GDPR guidance, and more through the **Microsoft Service Trust Portal**.
