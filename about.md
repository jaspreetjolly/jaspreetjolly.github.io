I am a Senior Solution Engineer with 22+ years of experience helping enterprises modernise their workplace, strengthen security, and accelerate productivity using Microsoft 365, Azure, and AI.

My career spans IT infrastructure consulting, presales advisory, and enterprise account strategy—allowing me to bridge deep technical expertise with real business impact. I specialise in Modern Work, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and secure cloud-led transformations that enable organisations to scale, automate, and innovate.

I lead technical strategy, design, and adoption for complex digital workplace initiatives, including competitive migrations to M365, cloud security modernisation, and AI-led productivity programs. Known for hands-on demos, clear storytelling, and fast execution, I simplify complexity and help customers unlock measurable business value.
